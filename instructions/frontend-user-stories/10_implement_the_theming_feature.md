### User Story title

As a developer, I want to implement a theming feature, so that we can easily switch between different color schemes in the application.

### Acceptance Criteria (this is mandatory section)

- [ ] 1. The application should support theming.
- [ ] 2. Two themes should be available: "Freedom Blue" and "Freedom Darker".
- [ ] 3. The theme can be set by the developers for now.
- [ ] 4. All components should be styled according to the selected theme.
- [ ] 5. Unit tests should be created for the theming feature, checking that the correct theme is applied to the components.
- [ ] 6. The themes should be applied correctly on mobile devices, ensuring good readability and contrast.

### Technical details (this is optional section, add it if necessary)

1.  Use CSS variables to handle the theme colors.
2.  The theme variables should be defined in a separate CSS file.
3.  The theme management should follow the best practices for React applications in 2025.
4.  The color palettes for the themes are defined in the business requirements document.
5.  Use `@testing-library/react` for testing the component.
