Please let's focus on the frontend application available at @packages/frontend: there are some specific business logic instructions in the
file @instructions/4_frontend_mvp_business_requirements.md.

Based on these instructions, please create User Stories to accomplish all the required features. The User Stories has to be compliant with all the best practices of Agile development guidelines, and they have to include detailed Acceptance Criteria on how to achieve the requirements.
Please consider checking the general instructions for the frontend code development available in @.gemini/GEMINI.md .

The User Stories will be used later on as input to an Agentic AI that will actually implement the Acceptance Criteria and business requirements in the code: for this reason, please be very specific and detailed in the User Stories definition.

Please save the User stories inside the folder @instructions/frontend-user-stories: they will be saved as markdown content, each User Story will be saved as standalone file, filename will contain incremental integer number and User Story title like these examples `2-HomePage View scaffolding`, `4-Form history management`
