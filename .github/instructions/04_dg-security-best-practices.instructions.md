# Security Best Practices

This document outlines essential security best practices and considerations. Adhering to these guidelines is crucial for protecting our users, data, and the platform itself. Security is a shared responsibility, and every developer should be mindful of these principles.

## 1. Authentication

Securely verifying the identity of users and services is fundamental.

- **API Authentication (Inter-Service):**
    - Use strong, unique API keys or tokens for service-to-service communication.
    - Store these credentials securely (e.g., environment variables, secrets management services like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager). **Never hardcode credentials in source code.**
    - Rotate API keys and tokens regularly according to security policy.
    - Use token-based authentication (e.g., OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow) where appropriate, with short-lived access tokens and secure refresh token mechanisms.
    - Always use HTTPS (TLS) for all API communications.

## 2. Authorization

Once authenticated, users and services must only be allowed to access resources and perform actions they are explicitly permitted to.

- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the minimum necessary permissions required for a user or service to perform its intended function.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement and consistently enforce RBAC within the CMS and for API access. Define clear roles with specific permission sets.
- **Resource-Based Authorization:** For actions on specific resources (e.g., editing a particular microsite), verify that the authenticated user has the rights to perform that action on that specific resource instance.
- **Regular Permission Audits:** Periodically review user roles and permissions to ensure they remain appropriate and to remove any excessive or unused privileges.
- **API Endpoint Authorization:** Every API endpoint must robustly verify that the caller (user or service) is authorized for the requested operation and resource.

## 3. Input Validation and Sanitization

Never trust user input or data from external sources. Validate and sanitize all incoming data to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.

- **Client-Side Validation:** Implement for user experience (quick feedback), but **never rely on it for security.**
- **Server-Side Validation:** **Always** validate all input on the server-side, regardless of client-side checks. This is your primary defense.
- **Schema Validation:** Use strong typing (TypeScript) and schema validation libraries (e.g., Zod, Joi, class-validator) to define and enforce expected data structures, types, formats, lengths, and ranges for all inputs (request bodies, query parameters, headers).
- **Output Encoding/Escaping:** When rendering user-supplied content in HTML, ensure it is properly encoded or escaped to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Use React's default JSX encoding, or appropriate templating engine features. For URLs, CSS, or JavaScript contexts, use context-specific encoding.
- **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:** When interacting with databases (even indirectly via an ORM), ensure that parameterized queries or prepared statements are used to prevent SQL injection.
- **File Uploads:**
    - Validate file types, sizes, and names.
    - Scan uploaded files for malware.
    - Store user-uploaded files in a separate, non-executable location (e.g., S3 bucket with restricted permissions), not directly within the application server's file system.
    - Serve user files from a different domain if possible to mitigate XSS risks.

## 4. API Security

- **HTTPS Everywhere:** All API communication must use HTTPS.
- **Input/Output Validation:** Rigorously validate all incoming request data and, where applicable, responses from services it calls.
- **Rate Limiting & Throttling:** Implement to prevent abuse, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and ensure fair usage.
- **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):** Configure CORS policies strictly to allow requests only from known and trusted origins. Avoid overly permissive configurations like `*`.
- **Error Handling:** Return generic error messages to clients. Avoid exposing sensitive system details, stack traces, or internal error codes in API responses. Log detailed errors internally.
- **Security Headers:** Implement relevant HTTP security headers (e.g., `Content-Security-Policy`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`).

## 5. Data Protection

- **Data Classification:** Classify data based on sensitivity (e.g., public, internal, confidential, PII).
- **Encryption at Rest:** Sensitive data stored in databases or file systems should be encrypted using strong, industry-standard algorithms.
- **Encryption in Transit:** All data transmitted over networks (internal and external) must be encrypted using TLS (HTTPS, secure database connections).
- **Data Minimization:** Collect, process, and store only the data absolutely necessary for the intended purpose.
- **PII (Personally Identifiable Information) Protection:** Handle PII with extreme care, adhering to GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant privacy regulations. Anonymize or pseudonymize PII where possible. Implement strict access controls for PII.
- **Secrets Management:** Store secrets (API keys, database credentials, certificates) securely using a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) or appropriately secured environment variables. Do not commit secrets to version control.

## 6. Preventing Common Vulnerabilities

- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):**
    - Use React's automatic JSX escaping.
    - Be cautious with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Sanitize HTML if it must be used.
    - Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP).
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):**
    - Use anti-CSRF tokens for state-changing requests (e.g., forms submitted by authenticated users).
    - Check `Origin` / `Referer` headers (as a secondary defense).
    - Use the `SameSite` cookie attribute.
- **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):** Ensure that users can only access resources they are authorized for, even if they can guess resource IDs. Always check ownership/permissions.
- **Security Misconfiguration:** Regularly review configurations of servers, frameworks, and libraries. Remove default credentials, disable unused features/services.
