# Coding Standards Overview

This section details the coding standards, style guides, and best practices for the developers. Adhering to these standards ensures code consistency, readability, maintainability, and overall quality.

## Key Documents

- **[JavaScript/TypeScript Style Guide](./01_dg-cs-js-ts-style-guide.instructions.md):**
  Provides specific guidelines, rules, and best practices for writing JavaScript and TypeScript code. This includes naming conventions, commenting, error handling patterns (at a code level), and language feature usage.

- **[Main Code Style and Quality Guide](05_dg-code_style.instructions.md):**
  Covers the overall approach to code style, including the automated tools used (ESLint, Prettier, Stylelint), how to find their configurations, and general guidelines on readability, simplicity, and DRY principles. It also explains how to handle disabling linting rules.

- **[React Best Practices (To be created/consolidated)]:**
  _(Placeholder for future document focusing on React-specific patterns, component design, hook usage, performance optimizations, etc.)_

- **[CSS/SCSS Guidelines (To be created/consolidated)]:**
  _(Placeholder for future document detailing CSS/SCSS naming conventions (e.g., BEM, if used), specificity management, and best practices for stylesheets, if not fully covered by Stylelint and the main [Styling Approach Guide](07_dg-styling-approach.instructions.md).)_

- **[Writing Tests Guide](08_dg-writing-tests-guide.instructions.md):**
  While not strictly "coding style," writing good tests is integral to our standards. These documents cover our testing philosophy, tools, and best practices for writing effective tests.

- **[Documentation Guidelines (To be created/consolidated)]:**
  _(Placeholder for standards on writing JSDoc, READMEs, and other forms of documentation.)_

## Purpose of Coding Standards

- **Consistency:** Code written by different developers looks and feels similar.
- **Readability:** Code is easier to understand, reducing cognitive load.
- **Maintainability:** Well-structured and consistent code is easier to debug, modify, and extend.
- **Collaboration:** Reduces friction when multiple developers work on the same codebase.
- **Quality:** Helps prevent common errors and promotes robust software design.
