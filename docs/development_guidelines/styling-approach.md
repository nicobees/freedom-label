# Styling Approach and Theming Guide

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the styling methodologies, technologies, and theming architecture used. Understanding these concepts is key to developing visually consistent and maintainable user interfaces.

## Core CSS Methodology

It follows a **component-based styling approach**. This means:

- Styles are closely co-located and scoped to the components they define.
- Encapsulation is prioritized to prevent global style conflicts.

## Styling Technologies

### 1. Global CSS

While component-scoped styling is preferred, some global CSS is necessary:

- **Resets/Normalize:** Base styles to ensure consistent rendering across browsers (e.g., `normalize.css` or a custom reset).
- **Typography:** Global font definitions (`@font-face`), base font sizes, and default text styles for `body`, headings, etc.
- **Grid System:** Global CSS classes for the layout grid.
- **Utility Classes:** A limited set of reusable utility classes for common styling needs (e.g., spacing, visibility). These should be used sparingly.

Global styles are typically imported at the application's entry point.

## Theming Architecture

This is the modern, preferred approach for theming and UI consistency.

- **Theme Tokens:** Provides a structured set of predefined design tokens (JavaScript objects) for colors, typography, spacing, elevations, etc.
- **Component Library:** Includes pre-styled React components built according to the design system.
- **`ThemeProvider`:** Integrates with componenst to make theme tokens available to all components.
- **TypeScript Support:** Offers strong typing for theme tokens and component props.

**Example Theme Structure (Simplified):**

```typescript
interface Theme {
	commons: {
		colors: { primary400: string; grey0: string /* ... */ };
		font: {
			sizes: { base: string; large: string /* ... */ };
			weights: { regular: number; bold: number /* ... */ };
		};
		spacing: { small: string; medium: string /* ... */ };
		// ... other common tokens
	};
	// ... other theme sections (e.g., component-specific tokens)
}
```

## Responsive Design

A combination of techniques ensures responsiveness:

- **CSS Grid & Flexbox:** Used extensively for creating fluid and adaptive layouts.
- **Media Queries:** Applied within components to adjust styles at different viewport breakpoints. Breakpoints are often sourced from the theme or a central CSS utility file.

    ```tsx
    // add example of media query applied to component with pure css
    ```

- **Responsive Hooks:** Custom hooks like `useIsSmOrGreater` allow components to adapt their rendering or logic based on viewport size in a way that's compatible with SSR.
